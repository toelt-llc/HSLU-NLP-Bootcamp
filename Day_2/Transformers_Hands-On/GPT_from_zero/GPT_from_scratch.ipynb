The model learns the importance of each input token (now represented with its embeddings) by calculating attention weights, which reflect the token's relevance to other tokens in the sequence. \n",

This can get a little more complex for multi-headed attention as you can see [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/transformers-explained-visually-part-3-multi-head-attention-deep-dive-1c1ff1024853) but once we have these matrices, we perform scaled dot-product attention by simply following this formula!\n",

    "Perplexity is a metric commonly used in the context of Language Models to evaluate the quality and performance of the model in predicting the next word or token in a sequence of words. It measures how well the language model assigns probabilities to a given sequence of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, perplexity is calculated using the concept of cross-entropy. The perplexity score is the exponential of the average cross-entropy per word in a given dataset. The formula for perplexity is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Perplexity} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{{\\sum_{{i=1}}^{{N}} \\log(p(w_i))}}{{N}}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ represents the total number of words in the dataset, and $(p(w_i))$ is the probability assigned by the language model to the $(i)$-th word in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula involves taking the logarithm of the model's predicted probabilities for each word in the sequence and summing them. Dividing this sum by the total number of words $(N)$ and then taking the exponential gives the perplexity score.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lower perplexity value indicates that the language model is more confident and accurate in its predictions, as it assigns higher probabilities to the true words in the dataset. Conversely, a higher perplexity score suggests that the model is more uncertain and less accurate in its predictions.\n",
