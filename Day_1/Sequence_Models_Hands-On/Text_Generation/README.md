# Deep Learning - Text generation

Have you ever dreamed of generating some text at random, based on an input sequence?

This exercise is actually some sort of prerequisite to such task. The goal is to predict the next letter given a string, which is basically a list of letters. In this way, you will be able to predict absurd sentences based on input strings.

In this exercise we will see a simplified version of https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation#download_the_shakespeare_dataset in order to generate our own shakespearean sentences!

When you are ready open **text_generation.ipynb** and get started!
