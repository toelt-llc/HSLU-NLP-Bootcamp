### Embeddings with word2vec

In this notebook, we will look at word2vec, a technique for word embedding.

The goal of word2vec is to provide a mapping from the dictionary of words present in a text to vectors of a fixed dimension. The main motivation is that working on words directly is not possible.

This exercise will help you to better understand embeddings in general.
