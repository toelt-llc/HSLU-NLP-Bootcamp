## Model fine-tuning üõ†Ô∏è

Now that you've seen what's possible with Transformer based models, we're going to take at how we can work with a family of encoder models called BERT!

Specifically, we're going to see how we can use them to create features for a classification Neural Network, then we'll go even deeper and start playing with the weights of the model, tuning it specifically on our desired task.
